    "Hi all, first, I want to apologize for not making it; I was very much looking forward to seeing/meeting all of you. Second, I want to stress that *since I wasn't quite sure who all would be in attendance*, I wanted to make this a very open introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of you may already know how to do all this (and much more), some of you may never have touched python before in your life. No worries either way. I'm going to try to keep this as self contained as possible. I'm sure there will be questions and I'm sure I'm going to make some mistakes trying to communicate all of this within the notebook itself; but, we're lucky enough to have the inimitable Ryan Burns here to help field those issues.\n",

    "## First things first, what is this document and how do we interact with it?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) which is the modern derivative of what was once an ipython notebook (this is why the file extension is .ipynb). At its core, it's a nicely open-source web application that lets us write code, execute it, and intersperse it with other media including (as I'm writing here) markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "I find it incredibly useful for distributing technical labs to students and have also used it for presentations and lectures. If you're locked into the ESRI ecosystem (no shame, some universities require it), you can actually run notebooks from within ArcGIS Pro as well. You can read more about that [here](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-notebooks/overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "But, right now, you're *probably* looking at this from where I've put it in github. Github will render the notebook, but it does so as a static image and doesn't execute the code (though it will keep visualizations that were present in the file when you commit it). I'm not going to assume folx know how to interact with github, but I'm also going to skip it as it's not **really** what I want to show you today. For what it's worth, you can get a desktop application for most OSes [here](https://desktop.github.com/), but I prefer to work with command-line git because it makes me feel like a hacker in a 90s movie (you can find documentation for that [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Something you might notice as we go on is that I'm going to provide a lot of links to documentation. That's because I'm constantly consulting it. I sincerely believe that one of the best skills one can have for working with code is the ability to parse documentation. Lame, but true. Also, I have a terrible memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you're a github wizard, feel free to grab this however you want. If you're not, go to the repository ([here](https://github.com/jethatch/digiws)), click on that green button that says 'code' and download the zip file of everything you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to be able to interact with it, we'll need to have Jupyter Notebooks installed. I am going to walk you through **one way** to do this using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). There are lots of other options! You could use [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), or even an online solution like [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/features/jupyter-notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "Heck, you can actually use an end-around to do this with just ArcGIS Pro installed. For folx that end up teaching/working in labs that *don't* let you install libraries, you can usually end-around this restriction if ArcPro is there by using what ESRI calls the 'Python Command Prompt' which is ultimately their branding on the Anaconda prompt (ESRI likes to ingest open-source stuff into their systems and then slap their names on it. Ask Dillon Mahmoudi about this and tell him I told you to, or not).\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to be **very clear** here: Using one approach or another doesn't make you better, harder, faster, stronger, smarter, or cooler. I strongly encourage everyone to use the tools that both make sense to them and will work for the task they have at hand. For this demonstration, I needed to pick something, so I picked this set of tools. What you should also realize (and which I'll bring up throughout this) is that each tool *does* come with a set of power relations embedded within it, a set of choices as to how it's intended to be used, and who it's intended to be used by. We'll splend plenty of time attempting to subvert some of these expectations, that doesn't mean we'll succeed. "

    "## Finally getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, so at this point I'm going to assume that you have the notebook file downloaded and that you have Anaconda installed (or are familiar enough with another system to have chosen to use that instead).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note: Most of these instructions are written for Windows. Linux is pretty straightforward, but Mac OS can sometimes through a few curveballs. Check out [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/mac-os/) on that front**. \n",
    "\n",
    "What we need to do now is:\n",
    "1. Create an environment for this workshop\n",
    "2. Install the necessary libraries\n",
    "3. Launch Jupyter\n",
    "4. Open this notebook from within Jupyter to make it fully interactive\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Creating an environment\n",
    "I'm going to do this using the Anaconda Prompt and the command line. There are many other ways, but I enjoy command line interfaces as noted above. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, open up your 'Anaconda Command Prompt' program (again, assuming you are in Windows. In Linux, you can usually just drop into your bash shell or whatever you use so long as your pathing is set up correctly, same with Mac and terminal).\n",
    "\n",
    "Type `conda create -n digiws python=3.8` and hit enter. Then confirm when prompted.\n",
    "This is going to create an [anaconda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html) for everything you do with this project. You generally want to create environments for all your major projects as that will keep version conflicts between libraries to a minimum. In other words, if one of your projects needs version 3.1 of GeoPandas to work and another needs version 3.2, if you tried to work in the same environment... you'd get errors. By setting up environments for each project, you make sure that version conflicts are minimized (note, I did not say eliminated...). It's also going to install python version 3.8 into that environment. You can choose another one, I just picked 3.8 because when I originally wrote some of what comes later in this lab, that's what I happened to be using.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once that's done, you'll want to activate said environment. On Windows, you type `conda activate digiws`; on Mac/Linux, the command is `source activate digiws`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before your drive prompt, you should now see a little `(digiws)` that lets you know which environment you have active. If you ever forget **any of this** (as I often do), the [Conda Cheat Sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf) is a lifesaver.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Installing the libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use a few libraries today just to set up a sample workflow from scraping data, to geocoding it, to putting it on a very simple webmap. I know that's not super exciting if you've done this stuff before, but I think there are interesting questions at each step that make working through them worthwhile. I'm also going to show you how you can loop ChatGPT into your workflow if you want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The libraries we'll use are: `jupyter, geopandas, geopy, plotly_express, and overpy`\n",
    "To install them, you type `conda install -c conda-forge jupyter geopandas geopy plotly_express overpy`\n",
    "You could leave out the `-c conda-forge` for many packages, it sets the 'channel' Anaconda looks for the packages in as conda-forge; here, we need it for GeoPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain each package: jupyter is jupyter notebooks; geopandas is an [open-source GIS](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/); geopy is wrapper for various [geocoders](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html); Overpy is an [overpass turbo wrapper](https://pypi.org/project/overpy/) that lets us query OSM data; and Plotly Express is a [high-level API for Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) that will help us make interactive maps, basically.\n",
    "\n",
    "What these libraries will allow us to do scrape some web data, process it a bit, then visualize it on an interactive map. \n",
    "While they install, sit back and feel like you're the star of a Hackers reboot.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Launch Jupyter\n",
    "Once everything is nice and installed, type in:\n",
    "`jupyter notebook`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will open up the Jupyter navigation pane in your default web browser. I use Edge because it's so bad it makes me laugh. I recommend against this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Open this notebook... again\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to wherever you have this notebook saved using the Jupyter navigator, and double click to open this notebook. It will open in a new window and if you click on any of the cells, you'll be able to interact with them.\n",

    "Well, now I want you all to think about a few things:\n",
    "1. Do you understand the code written by ChatGPT? Is it how you would write code? Did you understand the code that we walked through manually? Does the difference matter?\n",
    "2. Could you keep interacting with it to produce more and better visualizations and analysis (ask it to add different tiles, to bring in additional data, etc.)?\n",
    "3. What decisions is ChatGPT making? How does it elide choices we walked through (or does it)? What power relations does it normalize?\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot more to ask. There's a *ton* more to think through and potentially do. I don't have answers to any of the above; but, I would like to make clear a few things. I absolutely do not believe everyone needs to code or even interact with code, that's not what being a 'digital geographer' is about and I hope this workshop didn't give you that idea! I *do* think that thinking through what code is and what it does, how it shapes what we see and don't, how queries reflect data and how data (doesn't) reflect reality are fundamental questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's space for so many approaches, but here - at this tutorial - I hope I got you thinking about the decisions we make when we write code and what it means, a bit, to think with a corporate AI. What it enables and what it constrains.\n",
